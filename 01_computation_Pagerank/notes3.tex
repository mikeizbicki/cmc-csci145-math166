\section{Alternative Motivations}

Pagerank can be used in many situations besides web ranking.
In particular, if you can formalize your problem as somehow finding the ``most important'' nodes in a graph where something important is ``flowing'' between those nodes,
then you can use pagerank.

\begin{problem}
    Describe how pagerank can be used for the following tasks.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
            You are in charge of advertising the new Apple iGadget.
            You want to deliver free samples to Twitter influencers,
            with the hope that they will write good reviews that cause many people to purchase the iGadget.
            How do you select which people to give these free samples to?
            \newpage
        \item 
            You are the director of the CIA and you want to kill terrorists.
            How do you identify likely terrorists?


            \vspace{8in}
            NOTE:
            Former CIA director Michael Hayden famously said ``We kill people based on metadata.''
            This is exactly what he was referring to.
            See:

            %\end{quote}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\newpage
\begin{problem}
    Create an example problem statement similar to the problem statements from Problem 1 above,
    and describe how the problem can be solved using pagerank.
\end{problem}

%\begin{problem}
    %Describe a graph problem where it would NOT make sense to use pagerank.

%\section{Alternative Analysis}
%
%\begin{problem}
    %Previously, we analyzed the pagerank algorithm in terms of the residual $\ltwo{\x^{(k)} - \x^{(k-1}}$ since that is how the analysis was presented in the paper.
    %A slightly more powerful analysis is to directly measure the error of our algorithm
%\end{problem}

\newpage
\section{A Faster Algorithm?}

\begin{problem}
    There are many algorithms for computing top eigenvectors,
    and any of these algorithms can be used to compute the pagerank vector.
    In this problem, we will investigate the \emph{exponentially accelerated power method} (EAPM).
    This is a divide and conquer algorithm that can achieve the same accuracy $\epsilon$ as the power method with only a logarithmic number of iterations.

    Recall that in the standard power method, at each iteration we perform the computation in Eq (5.1) from the text.
    It is reproduced below:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pbb}
        \x^{(k)T} = {\x^{(k-1)T}} \pbb
        .
    \end{equation}
    Unraveling the recursion, we have that
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:pbbk}
        \x^{(k)T} = {\x^{(0)T}} \pbb^k
        .
    \end{equation}
    In the standard power method, we solve Eq \eqref{eq:pbbk} with a procedure involving $k$ matrix-vector operations.
    The key idea of the EAPM is to ``reparenthesize'' these operations to instead solve $\log k$ matrix-matrix operations.


    The output of the EAPM after $K$ iterations is the vector $\y^{(K)}$, which is defined as
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:exp:y}
        \y^{(K)} = \frac{\x^{(0)} \Q_K}{\ltwo{\x^{(0)} \Q_K}}
        ,
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:Qk}
        \Q_k = 
        \begin{cases}
            \pbb & \text{if}~k=0 \\
            \Q_{k-1} \Q_{k-1} & \text{otherwise} \\
        \end{cases}
        .
    \end{equation}
    In the standard power method, the matrix $\pbb$ is not stored explicitly;
    we substitute the definition of $\pbb$ into Eq \eqref{eq:pbb} above and perform all calculations on the sparse $\p$ matrix.
    In the EAPM, the $\pbb$ matrix is stored explicitly as a dense matrix,
    and each $\Q_k$ is also stored as a dense matrix.

    \begin{enumerate}
        %\item
            %Show that $\y^{(K)} = \x^{(2^K)}$.
            %This equivalence is why the algorithm is ``exponentially accelerated.''
%
            %HINT: 
            %Use induction to show that $Q_{K} = \pbb^{2^{K}}$.
            %The result follows by combining this fact with \eqref{eq:exp:y} and Equation (5.1) in the paper.
            %\vspace{3in}

        \newpage
        \item
            What is the runtime of calculating $\Q_k$ given $\Q_{k-1}$? 
            \vspace{4in}

        \item 
            What is the runtime of computing $\y^{(K)}$ in terms of $K$?
            \vspace{3in}

        \newpage
        \item
            As with the standard power method, we do not know the total number of iterations of the exponential power method in advance.
            Instead, we iterate until the answer is ``good enough''.
            For this problem, we will directly compare the distance between the $K$th iterate to the unknown pagerank vector,
            and iterate until the following condition is satisfied:
            \begin{equation}
                \label{eq:exp:eps}
                \ltwo{\y^{(K)}-\pr} \le \epsilon,
            \end{equation}
            where $\epsilon$ is a predetermined small constant value.
            The \emph{Deeper Inside Pagerank} paper does not discuss the EAPM algorithm, so I have provided below a simple theorem (without proof) about its convergence rate.
            \begin{theorem}
                \label{thm:EAPM}
                For all $K$, the EAPM satisfies
                \begin{equation}
                    \ltwo{\y^{(k)}-\pr} \le \alpha^{2^k}.
                \end{equation}
            \end{theorem}

            Use Theorem \ref{thm:EAPM} above to compute the number of iterations $K$ required to achieve a target $\epsilon$ value.
            %Bounding the number of iterations $K$ required to satisfy \eqref{eq:exp:eps} is a bit more technical than in the previous problem.
            %You do not have to compute a bound on $K$ yourself,
            %and may instead assume that 
            %\begin{equation}
                %\label{eq:exp:2}
                %K = O\bigg( \log \frac{\log \epsilon}{\log \alpha} \bigg)
            %\end{equation}
            %satisfies \eqref{eq:exp:eps}.
            %Notice that this number of iterations is logrithmic compared to the number of iterations in the standard power method,
            %and this is where the name exponentially accelerated comes from.

            %%You do not need to understand the technical details of the proof of \eqref{eq:exp:2},
            %%but it is reproduced below for the curious.
            %\begin{align}
                %\ltwo{\y^{(k)} - \y^{(k-1)}}
                %&= \ltwo{\x^{(2^k)} - \x^{2^{k-1}}} \\
                %&= \ltwo{\sum_{i=2^{k-1}}^{2^k - 1} (\x^{(i+1)} - \x^{(i)})} \\
                %&\le \sum_{i=2^{k-1}}^{2^k - 1} \ltwo{(\x^{(i+1)} - \x^{(i)})} \\
                %&\le \sum_{i=2^{k-1}}^{2^k - 1} \alpha^i \\
                %&\le 2^{k-1} \alpha^{2^{k-1}} \\
                %%&\le \alpha^{2^{k-2}}
                %&= O\bigg(\alpha^{2^{k-2}} \bigg)
                %\label{eq:exp:align}
            %\end{align}
            %Next, we set the right hand side of \eqref{eq:exp:align} less than $\epsilon$,
            %and solve for $k$.
            %\begin{align}
                %\alpha^{2^{k-2}} &\le \epsilon \\
                %{2^{k-2}}\log \alpha &\le \log \epsilon \\
                %{2^{k-2}} &\ge \frac{\log \epsilon}{\log \alpha} \\
                %k-2 & \ge \log_2\frac{\log \epsilon}{\log \alpha} \\
                %k & \ge 2 + \log_2\frac{\log \epsilon}{\log \alpha} \\
                %k & = O\bigg(\log \frac{\log\epsilon}{\log \alpha} \bigg) 
            %\end{align}
